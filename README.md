AMJ MOVIE is a simple movie web app I built to display some popular and upcoming movies and series, show their details and trailers and gives an option to add a movie of your choice to a watchlist. Its built in JavaScript and obtains the movie and series data via an API that I also built in Python. The data is stored in an sql database
